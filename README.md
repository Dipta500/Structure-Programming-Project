# Structure-Programming-Project
Using C++ Write a program to do the following: 1. Define a structure to store a date, which includes day(int), month (int), and year (int). 2. Define a structure to store an address, which includes address(house number and street) (string), city (string), state (string), zip code (string). 3. Define a class to store the following information about a student. It should include private  member variables: name (string), ID (int), date of birth (the first structure), address (the second structure), total credit earned (int), and GPA (double). And it also has public  member functions: constructors (at least one default and one non-default), Accessors and  Mutators for each member variable, and so on. (write definitions of at least one member  function outside the class) 4. Test each member function of the class in main function. Each piece information of a  student is inputted by user, not initialized by you (programmer) except for default  constructor. 5. In main function, choose any one student you defined, and then check whether the  student lives in the zip code of 11235 (close to school) or not, and check whether the  studentâ€™s birthday is in November or not.
